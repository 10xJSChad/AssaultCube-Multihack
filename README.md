# AssaultCube Radar & Aimbot Hack
### How to use:
1. Load up AssaultCube 1.3.0.0
2. Run 'ac cheat.py'
3. Hold Q to use the aimbot

### Problems:
* The radar is a bit short ranged, I could change it but I prefer it this way.
* On multiplayer servers, one player may not be found by the hack. (Possibly an easy fix, but hard to do because there are very few multiplayer servers with players on)
* Might not look that good on screens bigger or smaller than 1920x1080.
* Windowed/Fullscreen windowed is required to see the radar overlay.
