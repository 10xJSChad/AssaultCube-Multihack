# AssaultCube Multihack

### Features:
* Aimbot
* Aim assist (Configurable fov & speed)
* Radar
* Telekill (May crash if aim assist is enabled)
* Configurable speedhack
* Config menu (Press M)

### How to use:
1. Load up AssaultCube 1.3.0.0
2. Run 'ac cheat.py'

#### Keybinds:
* Q: Aimbot
* H: Telekill
* C: Speedhack
* M: Config menu

### Problems:
* The radar is a bit short ranged, I could change it but I prefer it this way.
* On multiplayer servers, one player may not be found by the hack. (Possibly an easy fix, but hard to do because there are very few multiplayer servers with players on)
* Windowed/Fullscreen windowed is required to see the radar overlay.
* The code is pretty spaghetti
